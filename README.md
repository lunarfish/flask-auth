# Flask auth

This module contains a bunch of helper functions and route
decorators for implementing access control in flask.

## static_site_wrapper_app.py

This is primarily aimed at adding access control to a
static site which has already been generated.

Access is managed by creating an `access-control.json` file
in the root of the static site and setting rules as follows:

```
{
  "paths": {
    "/index.html": {
      "open_access": true
    },
    "/function-x": {
      "message": "You need to be granted one of the function-x-roles",
      "open_access": false,
      "require_any": ["function-x-role-1", "function-x-role-2"]
    },
    "/team-y": {
      "message": "You need to be granted the team-y role.",
      "open_access": false,
      "require_any": ["team-y"]
    },
    "/team-y/function-x": {
      "message": "You need to be granted both the team-y and function-x roles.",
      "open_access": false,
      "require_all": ["team-y", "function-x"]
    }
  }
}
```

This means that the rules governing access are kept alongside
the static site content not separate from it.

The static site is then wrapped in a simple python flask app
which implements an `@auth.authorize_static(app)` decorator
on the static content route.

## auth.py

The decorator retrieves the static content, injects a login
component, implements the access rules and where necessary
replaces the `<main>` tag content with an access denied
template.

In addition to `@auth.authorize_static(app)` there are also
decorators for use in more conventional flask apps which
implement the same access controls.

## alb.py

There are also some helper functions for handling OIDC
authentication delegated to an AWS load balancer using
JWTs.

## Local development

You can run an instance of this app directly as follows:

### Create some SecureString SSM parameters
```
"/path/to/ssm/settings/flask/secret_key": "flask-secret",
"/path/to/ssm/settings/oidc/endpoint": "your.auth.service",
"/path/to/ssm/settings/oidc/client_id": "oidc-client-id",
"/path/to/ssm/settings/oidc/client_secret": "oidc-client-secret"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

### Setup your environment

```
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export SSM_PREFIX=/path/to/ssm/settings
export AUTH_MODE=flask
export STATIC_ROOT=/path/to/static/site/content/
export FLASK_APP=static_site_wrapper_app:bootstrap
```

### Run with AWS creds

```
flask run
```

## Packaging

### requirements.txt or equivalent

```
git+https://github.com/alphagov/cybersecuritytools.git@authed-tech-docs#egg=flaskauth&subdirectory=cybersecuritytools/flaskauth
```
### entrypoint.py

Create a script to point your lambda at:

```
from flaskauth.lambda_handler import lambda_handler # noqa
```

Your lambda entrypoint would then be `entrypoint.lambda_handler`
